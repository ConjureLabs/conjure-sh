# Open-Sourcing Conjure

Recently [I tweeted](https://twitter.com/timothymarshall/status/1011315206406881283) that I would open-source Conjure. Today I'm happy to announce that that promise has been kept, and Conjure is now open. 

I spent a lot of time building this out, and hope others will benefit from it. I kept thinking of how [Ghost](https://ghost.org/) open-sourced their project while providing a paid hosted service. Based on the same setup, [Conjure.sh](https://conjure.sh) will remain as a paid service, while anyone is welcome to clone the repos and spin them up for free.
