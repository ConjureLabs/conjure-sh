# Open-Sourcing Conjure

Recently [I tweeted](https://twitter.com/timothymarshall/status/1011315206406881283) that I would open-source Conjure. Today I'm happy to announce that Conjure is fully open. I started Conjure to solve a common problem I had with testing pull requests. 

[Conjure.sh](https://conjure.sh) will remain as a paid service, while anyone is welcome to spin up their own clone for free.
