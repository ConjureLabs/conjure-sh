# Why Conjure?

When teams move fast, that means more frequent reviews. GitHub is great for reviewing code changes, but engineers still need to spin up the branch locally if they want to see visual changes. That means stashing ongoing changes, and context switching. All too often engineers will not review visual changes, and only look at code.

The goal of Conjure is to eable teams to review changes faster, without the overhead of local environments. This means giving engineers quick access to view changes, and giving product managers, designers, and other team members an easy wasy to see active workstreams. Giving anyone the chance to be part of the review process.
