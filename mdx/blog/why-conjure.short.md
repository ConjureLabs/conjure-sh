# Why Conjure?

When an engineer begins reviewing pull requests, they need to stop what they're doing, stash any code, check out the branch, and spin it up. There is context switching and wait times for builds to run.

On top of that, other team members usually only see changes after they land. Unless they constantly ping engineers for updates.

The goal of Conjure is to enable teams to review visual changes fast and easily, without the overhead of local instances. This means giving engineers quick access to view changes. And giving product managers, designers, and other team members visibility into active workstreams. Everyone should be able to be part of the review process.
