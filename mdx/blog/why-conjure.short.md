# Why Conjure?

In order for an engineer to properly review changes, their code needs to be stashed, and the branch being reviewed needs to be checked out and spun up. There is context switching and wait times for builds to run.

On top of that, other team members can only see working changes if they hover over the engineer or explicitly ask for an image. Design teams, on the other hand, have tools to show changes, get feedback, and involve others, while engineers work in a black box.

The goal of Conjure is to enable teams to review visual changes fast and easily, without the overhead of local instances. This means giving engineers quick access to view changes, and giving product managers, designers, and other team members an easy way to see active workstreams. Giving anyone the chance to be part of the review process.
